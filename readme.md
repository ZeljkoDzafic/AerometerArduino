Aerometer Arduino 
===================
Aerometer Arduino  is open-source project built  as part of my research. 
It uses Arduino Nano and  following sensors:

- DHT 22 
- MQ2
- MQ135
- MQ7
- BMP085 BMP-180
to collect data about air quality.

Airmetrics contain CO, CO2, LPG, smoke levels and information about humidity, pressure and temperature. 
Collected data is displayed on 16x2 LCD or TFT and sent in form of JSON object using serial
